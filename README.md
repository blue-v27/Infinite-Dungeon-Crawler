This was a passion project I submited as my graduation project back in highschool despite it beinng way more than what was asked of us ( that would have been a website made with any online edittor)

things to improve:
- ENEMY variation
- ROOM SIZE variation
- random BOOS fights
- different PROJECTILES
- CONSUMABLES around the map such as Health Bonuses or Exploding Rounds
- slicker UI
- better GRAPHICS
- NOT RENDERING off camera rooms for better performance
- UPGRADES
